# Product Quantity Step
This Opencart module will allow you to set a quantity step value. 

## Getting Started
First, upload all of the files included in the "upload" folder to your Opencart store. Second, install the module from the admin dashboard. Third, go into the "Product Quantity Step" module dashboard and set the module settings.

### Prerequisites
You will need the latest version of VQMod, jQuery, and your theme must use Bootstrap.

### Module Settings
There are 3 module settings: "Manual", "Product Data", "Same For All Products".

#### * Manual
This setting allows you to set the quantity-step value manually for each product in the 'Edit Product' page.
#### * Product Data
This setting allows you to set the quantity-step value to match each products' data value such as 'Minimum' or 'Quantity'. For example, if your products have a minimum quantity value of 10, then the quantity step value will be 10 as well.
#### * Same For All Products
This setting allows you to set one quantity-step value for all of your products.
